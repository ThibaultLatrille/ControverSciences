# ControverSciences

## Get ControverSciences up and running for developpement on Linux

### Clone the repository and cd to the dir

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ThibaultLatrille/ControverSciences.git
$ cd /ControverSciences
```

### Install RVM for managing ruby version

Follow steps in
[https://rvm.io/](https://rvm.io/)

Don't forget to append '--rails --ruby' for a all in one installation

ControverSciences is currently using ruby 2.1.2
```
rvm install 2.1.2
rvm use 2.1.2
gem install bundler
```

### Install PostgreSQL 9.4 and create role

Install the Postgresql libraries:

```
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4
$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

Then create the user (AKA "role") inside PostgreSQL:

```
$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql -d postgres
postgres=# create role controversciences login superuser password 'password';
postgres=# \q
```


### Install the gems

```
$ bundle install
```

### Create database and populate with Fake data

```
$ rake db:create
$ sh ./dump/pg_restore
```

If you get an error at this step, as the following:

```
could not connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host "localhost" (::1) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
could not connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host "localhost" (127.0.0.1) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432? 
```

It may be because the postgresql port is not well defined. Please check in the config file `/etc/postgresql/9.4/main/postgresql.conf` that `port=5432`.

### Run local webserver

```
$ rails s
```

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:3000 with your favorite browser and you are Up & Running

## Repopulate the database after a maj or if you screwed the database

```
$ rake db:drop db:create
$ sh ./dump/pg_restore
```

### Connect as an admin of the website in the local version

* Login : administrator@controversciences.org
* Password: 'password'
